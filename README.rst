The Bump calculator
################################

This code takes a light-curve (jd, magnitude and magnitude error)  and finds the secondary bump in the R-band for type Ia supernovae. It can easily be adapted to measure the secondary bump in other photometric bands by changing the range of dates from which one expects a bump. For a more detailed account on this method and application see Papadogiannakis et al. 2017 (in prep).
